### Sparta jQuery TicTacToe

### This project uses jQuery to create the two player game TicTacToe
This was a challenging project that I had difficulty getting to grips with since my jQuery knowledge was not up to scratch.
<br>
After using the Traversy YouTube video to aid me, I started became more comfortable with the challenge and managed to put the naughts and crosses on the template board. I was then able to deal with the reset button event and refresh the board.
 
### Installation:
Dgit@github.com:NIOfonagoro/sparta-jQuery-tictactoe.git
### Challenges
As mentioned above, this was a challenging project and initial had difficulty understanding the jQuery notations.
<br>
After becoming more familiar, my major issues came with attempting track which of the players win. My initial idea was to use the "data-num" attributes and their values and create a function that checks through all the winning combinations to determine the winner. Unfortunately I struggled to access these values, even when attempting to just console.log() them.
